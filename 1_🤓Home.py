st.write('''Airlines play a pivotal role in global transportation, connecting
            people and goods across vast distances. They operate a complex network of
            routes, managing everything from aircraft maintenance to customer service
            Airlines own or lease a fleet of aircraft to transport passengers and cargo.
            These fleets can range from small regional jets to large intercontinental planes.
            Airlines factor in various operating costs, including fuel, aircraft maintenance, crew salaries,
            airport fees, and insurance. Ticket prices fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics. Popular 
            routes during peak travel seasons often have higher prices. Prices are influenced by competition within
            the airline industry. Airlines may adjust their fares to remain competitive with other carriers operating
            on the same routes Airlines generate additional revenue through ancillary services like baggage fees, seat 
            selection, in-flight meals, and entertainment In essence, airline ticket prices are the result of a complex 
          interplay between operational costs, market forces, and consumer behavior. By understanding these factors,
          travelers can make informed decisions when booking flights.''')
